# Global-warming
All information related to Global warming

## Aim

The aim of this repository is to gather all information related to Global warming and show-case the gathered info in an organised way such that most of the people can understand the effect of Global warming.

If you want to help, you are most welcome to contribute to this repository. Please read [contribution guidelines](/contribution.md) before starting to contribute.

## How our world works?

Our world is a Marvel which is perfectly engineered. Instead of talking technically, I will try here to explain things in simple words.

Comparing to other planets or Celestial bodies, our planet Earth has a protective layer around it which is made of abundance of Oxygen gas. This protective layer is known as Ozone layer. Because of this Ozone layer there is life on this planet. If this Ozone layer wasn't present, then our planet would have been similar to other planets i.e uninhabited.

#### How Ozone layer is protecting us?

According to Science, if Sun rays falls directly upon the planet Earth then most of the living beings (_including humans_) can't survive because sun rays consists of dangerous as well as normal radiations. These dangerous radiations are being stopped to reach on Earth's surface by the Ozone layer.

#### What's happening to the Ozone layer?

#### What are the consequences if the Ozone layer is absent?

## Global warming effecting factors


#### Usage of Fossil fuels:

Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy resources. That means we can't reproduce/recycle it. Fossil fuels are formed by decomposition of plants and animals inside Earth for a period of more than 100 million years. There are three type of fossil fuels like Coal, Oil and Natural gas. I don't want to go deep on why/how these fossil fuels are used, I will just stick on why the combustion of fossil fuels is Evil, IMO.

Fossil fuels generate a huge amount of energy by combustion process. In combustion process, the result will be Energy + Heat (`co2`). This heat when gone into outermost layers of our atmosphere where ozone is present, it reacts with the ozone

Petrol is like boon to our society. When petrol is combusted, we can produce lots of energy which can be used for many good things like travelling long distances in short time. Travelling in short time is possible by using machines which can combust this petrol (known as Vehicles).

#### Garbage:

#### Deforestation:

#### Water table:

#### Livestock:
