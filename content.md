# How our world works?

Our world is a Marvel which is perfectly engineered. Instead of talking technically, I will try here to explain things in simple words.

Comparing to other planets or Celestial bodies, our planet Earth has a protective layer around it which is made of abundance of Oxygen gas. This protective layer is known as Ozone layer. Because of this Ozone layer there is life on this planet. If this Ozone layer wasn't present, then our planet would have been similar to other planets i.e uninhabited.

### How Ozone layer is protecting us?

According to Science, if Sun rays falls directly upon the planet Earth then most of the living beings (_including humans_) can't survive because sun rays consists of dangerous as well as normal radiations. These dangerous radiations are being stopped to reach on Earth's surface by the Ozone layer.

### What's happening to the Ozone layer?

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains that the ozone layer of the atmosphere, Earth's protective layer, is being damaged by human activities, particularly the production of greenhouse gases.These gases are known to erode the surface of the ozone layer, meaning that its protective properties are consistently being diminished over time.
The EPA explains that less protection from the ozone layer means higher levels of ultraviolet light from the sun are streaming through the Earth's atmospheric layer and causing damage not only damage to crops but to people as well. The destruction of the ozone layer has led to an international cooperation between 190 government agencies around the world, including the EPA, geared towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preserving the ozone layer.
NASA Ozone Watch reports that the largest tear within the ozone layer is located over Antarctica, and that the damage is due to extreme reactions between unnaturally high concentrations of bromine and chlorine gases trapped within the layers of the atmosphere. The website explains that although there has been a hole in the southern polar region for decades, the extent of the damage has been growing consistently worse since then, and in 2013, it had reached its peak for the first time since 1979.



### What are the consequences if the Ozone layer is absent?

### Usage of Fossil fuels:

Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy resources. That means we can't reproduce/recycle it. Fossil fuels are formed by decomposition of plants and animals inside Earth for a period of more than 100 million years. There are three type of fossil fuels like Coal, Oil and Natural gas. I don't want to go deep on why/how these fossil fuels are used, I will just stick on why the combustion of fossil fuels is Evil, IMO.

Fossil fuels generate a huge amount of energy by combustion process. In combustion process, the result will be Energy + Heat (`co2`). This heat when gone into outermost layers of our atmosphere where ozone is present, it reacts with the ozone

Petrol is like boon to our society. When petrol is combusted, we can produce lots of energy which can be used for many good things like travelling long distances in short time. Travelling in short time is possible by using machines which can combust this petrol (known as Vehicles).
